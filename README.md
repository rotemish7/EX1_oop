In this project we created a number of classes that represents Monom,Polynom and Complexfunction.
each class has its own functions, and has its own implemntetion.
even more we created a JUnit test for each class of the above to test different scenarios of inputs.

We alse created a GUI class that draws the function so it can be visible for us to see them on a graph.

Monom class

each Monom is composed of a coefficeint -a and power-b, for example: ax^b

 main functions are:
equals-return true or false wheter an object is equals to a monom
f- return the value of the monom in the given x-real number.
derivative - return the monom after the derivative action.
toString - return a string represents the monom

there are some functions in the class for more info go to our Wiki.

Polynom class

each Polynom is composed of a several monom saved in an arraylist

main functions are:
